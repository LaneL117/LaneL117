  <p>Welcome to my blog! I'm Lane. I'm currently a student at RDP and am working through the new computer programming course. I enjoy playing video games, going to the gym, and hanging out with friends. I was raised in Consort Alberta and went to Consort School for my education through high school. My blog will tell of some of my experiences throughout my academic year and some time before it. Consort is a pretty sports heavy school so I have played and spectated many sports, my favorite being basketball.</p>
